<h1>Preparing for my postgraduate work</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Learning Python with no background in programming</h3>
<p>I went around the app store and looked for a few apps that all taught python. I installed about 5 of them, trying each for a day. Until I found one:</p>

</a>
<br>
<p>Mimo was an excellent starting point for me. It was gamified like DuoLingo and held my hand every step of the way.</p>
<p>Im currently 10/14 modules complete. When I hit 7/14, my partner who is a programming god (<i>at least to me</i>), suggested starting on Exercism.</p>

<h3>I have been accepted into Postgraduate AI & ML!</h3>
<p>I have been accepted into a Graduate Certificate of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with the University of Adelaide.</p>

</a>
<br>
<p>This is very exciting news to finish the year off with. I have been working consistently with Mimo and Exercism, as well as this website to ensure I am as prepared as possible. If all things go well, I am planning to extend this into a Masters.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Aaaand that's it for Mimo's Python Path</h3>
<p>At this stage I've completed all 14 modules of Python with Mimo. I am also about 28% of the way through the Python track on Exercism.</p>
<a style="display: flex; justify-content: center;" title="Python Certificate">

</a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>It came with a little certificate!</i></p>
<p>This definitely feels like a solid introduction to programming and a good way to gain some background for my upcoming degree. It's also nice that everything so far was free.</p>
