title: Just Over Halfway Done With Trimester 2
---

### I Cannot Believe It's Now Week 8
This trimester has really rocketed past me! It has gone by so fast, that I remember telling myself in **Week 6** that I should make a post about being halfway through after I finish my Math Assignment… It’s now *week 8*

The last couple of weeks have been hectic, I’ve had a few math assignments and tests due, as well as a computer science exam and a mathematics mid trimester exam. Although it has been nice to sharpen some skills and learn even more about linear algebra.

In mathematics we’ve covered topics such as probability, matrices, linear equations and set theory. Meanwhile in computer science we have been learning about Test Driven Development (TDD), structured data, and Pandas. 

In comparison to my Bachelors in Science, I’ve found assessment in this course a lot more engaging. Most of my subjects in Science would have a 70% final exam, while computer Science has an exam every four weeks with an 85% hurdle. It is still stressful mind you, but I like the idea of learning something, consolidating it, and then testing it before building further. It really gives a sense of knowing a topic through and through.

Also, in the interim I have been making sure to make this blog feel a bit more like home. I’ve introduced a few little features like:
- Pagination
- A Favicon
- Pinned Posts
