### Aaaand that's it for Mimo's Python Path
At this stage I've completed all 14 modules of Python with Mimo. I am also about 28% of the way through the Python track on Exercism.

    <a style="display: flex; justify-content: center;" title="Python Certificate">
        <img src="https://drackonack.github.io/assets/img/Python Certificate.png" alt="Python Certificate" width="30%" height="30%">
    </a>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <i>It came with a little certificate!</i>
    </p>

This definitely feels like a solid introduction to programming and a good way to gain some background for my upcoming degree. It's also nice that everything so far was free.
