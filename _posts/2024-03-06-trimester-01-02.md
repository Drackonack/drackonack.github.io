### Halfway Through Trimester 1
We are now about halfway through the trimester. Week 6 has just finished and I'm gearing up for week 7. 

So far, this has been a trialling time. Although grade wise I have been doing well, I've been struggling to maintain a solid work ethic. This has largely been due to everybodies least favourite single-stranded RNA virus, COVID, coming for about a 10 day stay starting in week 5.

The Mimo app in conjunction with Exercism has really prepared me well for my Fundamentals of Computer Science course. I have learned a lot and been able to reinforce all of my knowledge to this point. I even got 100% in my first section exam! 

I was able to also submit my first of four assignments for my Concepts of AI and ML course. I'm proud of this effort as it was an uphill battle against my own COVID addled mind. No marks have come back yet but I am otherwise doing well in this course also.

^An exciting update, I recieved a 100% for this as well! Also it turns out gridsearch optimisation has been a favourite of mine so far. 

Wish me luck for the latter half of this trimester, I will need all the luck I can get haha.
