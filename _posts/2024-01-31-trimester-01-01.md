title: Trimester 1 Begins!

### The First Week Back
For this trimester, I will be taking Foundations of Computer Science A and Concepts in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.

The last two months of [preparing](https://drackonack.github.io/2023/12/14/pre-post-grad.html) have been very helpful for me, especially in finding my feet. This is a relief because I thought I would drown in my first foundations class ðŸ˜…. It has been encouraging to discover the lecturer's approach to learning. They allow multiple attempts at assessments which really helps decipher what the code should do and how it outputs. Allowing for maximum learning through mistakes and therefore practice. 

The concepts of AI and ML class has been great as well! The lecturer has been engaging and welcoming. Although the "background" mathematical concepts required have been intimidating. They are varied and include vectors, hyperplanes, matrices, tensors, calculus, and probability. 
So, make sure to wish me luck!

Also, it would be fair to credit my partner who has allowed this opportunity by financially supporting us while I pursue a career change and higher education. Thank you so much!
