### The First Week Back
For this trimester, I will be taking Foundations of Computer Science A and Concepts in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.

The last two months of [preparing](https://drackonack.github.io/_posts/2023-12-14-pre-post-grad.md) have been very helpful for me, especially in finding my feet. This is a relief because I thought I would drown in my first foundations class ðŸ˜…. It has been encouraging to discover the lecturer's approach to learning. They allow multiple attempts at assessments which really helps decipher what the code should do and how it outputs. Allowing for maximum learning through mistakes and therefore practice. 

Also it would be fair to credit my partner who has allowed this oppurtunity by financially supporting us while I pursue a career change and higher education. Thank you so much!
