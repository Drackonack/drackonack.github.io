title: Starting A PhD In 2026
---

### New Beginnings For Me And The University
It feels weird being back at uni for a PhD. It's honestly almost like starting my bachelors again, only I'm 30 not 17 haha. That being said it is daunting having a 4 year program ahead, where the output needs to push the boundary of current knowledge, especially because I still feel relatively new to AI and computer science in general. To put the feeling into words its close to that feeling of being out of your depth combined with a little pre stress anxiety. Strangely though it also feels good, like it's real and I'm ready to get started!

Monday was my first day and I have had my first meeting with my supervisor, given papers to read, been allocated a desk, and some online modules to complete. So, I'm writing this post in a break to soak it all in haha.

To help with balancing my life I have unfortunately had to quit my role at Barosa Eye Clinic. I really had a good time! I loved my coworkers and engaging with patients. Maybe when the PhD is done I'll go back and be a research engineer full time...

With AI Camp I am now teaching an additional class at St Peter's College. The class there have been really engaging and provide a different experience for me than other age groups and classrooms. I have also been developing a workshop to give provide hands on AI skills development to NDIS clients via CBS. This has been really rewarding work and I'm excited to deliver that after this week!

I have also picked up a role with the new university, Adelaide University, to tutor a Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) course called Grand Challeneges, with A/prof Anthony Dick. I'm excited to try teaching at a tertiary level! The course content also looks quite interesting, as a bonus. 😅

So, there is a lot to work through balance and focus on! Wish me luck and stay tuned for updates/news/complaints/celebrations!

 

*Just a little post script mention for my partner! Originally, I was only supoosed to be taking a 6 month to 2 year break from full time work to reskill into a different industry. It will now, all things on track, be a 6 year endeavour. So if you're reading this, thankyou~~*
