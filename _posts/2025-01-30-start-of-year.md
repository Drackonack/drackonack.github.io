### A Busy But Exciting Start To The Year
This month although restful was busy leading up to the start of Trimester 1. To share the news and busy-ness, I was successful in securing an internship with AIML, I've managed to get a position as a teaching assistant at [AICamp](https://aicamp.com.au/ 'AI Camp home website link'), and have confirmed my position as an Academic Ambassador! 

So, due to the Internship my trimester will also comprise of Concepts in Cyber Security, and Human and Ethical Factors in Computer Science. I am excited to get a look at the world of cybersecurity and how design is implemented for different systems.

Also for my Ambassador role, I was tasked with writing a short bio. It is to be used by the uni on their website so that students can reach out to me. I've decided to clip it below, not only because I think I did a good job but also so that I have a record of it; despite not loving the photo that **I** chose haha.
