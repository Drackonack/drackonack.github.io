### A Busy But Exciting Start To The Year
This month although restful was busy leading up to the start of Trimester 1. To share the news and busy-ness, I was successful in securing an internship with AIML, I've managed to get a position as a teaching assistant at AI camp, and have confirmed my position as an Academic Ambassador! 

Resulting in this semester comprising of STEM Internship, Concepts in Cyber Security, and Human and Ethical Factors in Computer Science. I am excited to engage with all of my topics this trimester. I think they will provide a good broad knowledge base for future roles and professional development.

I wrote a bio for my academic ambassador role. I've decided to clip it below, not only because itâ€™s nice but that way I have a record of it; despite not loving the photo that **I** chose anyway haha.
