title: Trimester 3 is Underway
---

### The Last Trimester of The Year
Trimester 3 is well and truly underway, it is ***already*** week 4. 

The break between trimester 2 and 3 was almost negligible but was still enjoyable. I ended up catching up with some old friends, playing a few video games, laying in the sun, and frankly just sleeping!

All that be as it may, I now have got back into the swing of things with Deep Learning Fundamentals (DLF) and Philosophy - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
- DLF has been engaging and I have really enjoyed putting together my first assignment. I am developing and optimising a perceptron to analyse a diabetes dataset, then performing the write up in $LaTeX$.
- Philosophy has also been quite engaging, disccussing topics like, the COMPAS software, automated weapons systems, and decompositional analysis. It has really made ride home after lecture quite interesting haha.
