## Introducing my 5-Flower Classifier on Hugging Face!
I'm happy to announce the launch of the 5-Flower Classifier on Hugging Face Spaces.

### What is the 5-Flower Classifier?
The 5-Flower Classifier is a CNN model designed to classify five different types of flowers: Daisy, Dandelion, Tulip, Rose, and Sunflower. I've made this based on the VGG-16 architecture, and trained the model on a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

### Why Hugging Face?
Hugging Face is solid platform for sharing and deploying machine learning models. It is a well presented, has a large community, and isnt too hard to learn, making it a great place to showcase my 5-Flower Classifier and make it accessible all of you!

### How Can You Access the 5-Flower Classifier?
You can access the 5-Flower Classifier right now on Hugging Face Spaces! 

Simply visit the following link to explore the model and see it in action:
