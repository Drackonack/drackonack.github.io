### Learning Python with no background in programming
I went around the app store and looked for a few apps that all taught python. I installed about 5 of them, trying each for a day. Until I found one:

</a>


Mimo was an excellent starting point for me. It was gamified like DuoLingo and held my hand every step of the way.
I'm currently 10/14 modules complete. When I hit 7/14, my partner who is a programming god (*at least to me*), suggested starting on Exercism.

### I have been accepted into Postgraduate AI & ML!
I have been accepted into a Graduate Certificate of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with the University of Adelaide.

</a>

This is very exciting news to finish the year off with. I have been working consistently with Mimo and Exercism, as well as this website to ensure I am as prepared as possible. If all things go well, I am planning to extend this into a Masters.

### Aaaand that's it for Mimo's Python Path
At this stage I've completed all 14 modules of Python with Mimo. I am also about 28% of the way through the Python track on Exercism.

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <i>It came with a little certificate!</i>
    </p>

This definitely feels like a solid introduction to programming and a good way to gain some background for my upcoming degree. It's also nice that everything so far was free.

### 50 down and another 20 to go!
I set myself the challenge of solving at least 50% of Exercism's Python coding challenges before heading off for uni. At first this seemed quite daunting but its slowly coming together. The trick is to put the problem down and come back to it with fresh eyes... or eventually after many hours and days, asking a friend for help!

If i get through this goal with some time before classes begin, I was thinking of either spending some time in blender or maybe making a D&D 5e character sheet in Python.

### 50% of Exercism's Python track
With a fair margin of 17 days until uni starts back up, I have just now completed my 50% completion target!

It is very satisfying to be able to set yourself a goal and achieve it. I have really enjoyed the puzzle a day approach and have found some very good resources to learn by in the process.
