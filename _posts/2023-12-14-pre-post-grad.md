### Learning Python with no background in programming
I went around the app store and looked for a few apps that all taught python. I installed about 5 of them, trying each for a day. Until I found one:

</a>


Mimo was an excellent starting point for me. It was gamified like DuoLingo and held my hand every step of the way.
I'm currently 10/14 modules complete. When I hit 7/14, my partner who is a programming god (*at least to me*), suggested starting on Exercism.

### I have been accepted into Postgraduate AI & ML!
I have been accepted into a Graduate Certificate of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with the University of Adelaide.

</a>

This is very exciting news to finish the year off with. I have been working consistently with Mimo and Exercism, as well as this website to ensure I am as prepared as possible. If all things go well, I am planning to extend this into a Masters.

### Aaaand that's it for Mimo's Python Path
At this stage I've completed all 14 modules of Python with Mimo. I am also about 28% of the way through the Python track on Exercism.

        <i>It came with a little certificate!</i>

This definitely feels like a solid introduction to programming and a good way to gain some background for my upcoming degree. It's also nice that everything so far was free.
