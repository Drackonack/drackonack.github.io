### The First Week Of Trimester 2
As much as the relaxing has been nice, the new trimester is also a nice return to routine. 

For this Trimester I will be completing Mathematical Foundations of Data Science and Foundations of Computer Science B. 

I seemed to somehow have forgotten that I would have to learn some mathematics for this degree. I haven't completed a mathematics course since my undergraduate, way back when, within Statistical Practice 1 (Life Sciences). The math this week was daunting but was still accessible. We were looking at all things dataframes within python, as well as set theory, functions, and summation.

... I have already gained an increased appreciation for mathematicians.  

The Foundations of Computer Science B course has been good. I have learned more about shell and Unix. Both topics that I glazed over in my preparations for this course but am grateful to be learning. I look forward to learning more formally about Git next week though. That way I dont ruin my own repositories again haha.
