### A Nice Break Between Years
It has truly been a huge year for me!

Iconic 2024 Moments:
- Started my Graduate Certificate in AI and ML
- Finished my Graduate Certificate in AI and ML
- Successfully transferred into the Maseters of AI and ML
- 2/3 Trimesters were a 7 GPA!
- Helped start the ML AI social group at UofA
- Got the Academic Integrity Ambassador role (Just found out 🎉)
- Wrote so much code and only cried a little bit
- Saw the MONA (again) and the Gardens on Fire exhibition
- Went to Sydney and Hobart
- Drank my body weight in coffee at least 10x
- Survived a series of migraines that arose from hell itself

It's looking like 2025 should be a fun one! <br> I've also applied for a scholarship for my Masters project, with AIML so fingers crossed 🤞

Stay cool and Happy Holidays! ☀️🎄🎉
