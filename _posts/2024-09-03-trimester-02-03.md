title: Trimester 2 | Completion | Graduate Certificate
---

### Trimester 2 Absolutely Slipped Past!

Trimester 2 is officially completed, and with that, my Graduate Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is complete! ðŸŽ‰ It's a thrilling milestone, though the excitement is tempered by the reality that Trimester 3 is already underway ðŸ« .

This last trimester was packed to the brim with equally challenging but also rewarding concepts.

- **Mathematical Foundations of Data Science**: This course really gave me an understanding of key concepts like Limits, Summation, Matrices, Gradient Descent, Integration, and Googleâ€™s PageRank algorithm. I was even able to, *eventually*, wrap my head around Gradient Descent.

- **Computer Science B**: This subject was time consuming but worthwhile, I was taught how and where to Refactor code, Searching and Sorting algorithms, Dijkstraâ€™s  Shortest Path Algorithm, Graphs, and finally Trees. I enjoyed the new approaches to storing data and how pointers really help with data access, maintenance, and storage.
