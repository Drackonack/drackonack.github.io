title: Trimester 2 | Completion | Graduate Certificate
---

### Trimester 2 Absolutely Slipped Past!

Trimester 2 is officially completed, and with that, my Graduate Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is complete! ðŸŽ‰ It's an exciting milestone, although it is already tempered by the reality that Trimester 3 has begun ðŸ« .

That being said the last trimester was packed to the brim with challenging but also rewarding concepts.

- **Mathematical Foundations of Data Science**: This course really gave me an understanding of key concepts like Limits, Summation, Matrices, Gradient Descent, Integration, and Googleâ€™s PageRank algorithm. I was even able to, *eventually*, wrap my head around Gradient Descent. I have developed such a deep appreciation of mathematicians now.

- **Computer Science B**: This subject was time consuming but worthwhile, I was taught how and where to Refactor code, Searching and Sorting algorithms, Dijkstraâ€™s  Shortest Path Algorithm, Graphs, and finally Trees. I enjoyed the new approaches to storing data and how pointers really help with data access, maintenance, and storage.
