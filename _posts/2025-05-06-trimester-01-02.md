### I Am Still Tired Boss!
Trimester 1 is over and I havent been quite so busy for a little bit. It was nice though because it all went by so fast and I've learned a lot!

I'm still at AI Camp and have had a good time teaching the kids all about AI. They find it enagging and I don't mind making the material. I find what helps me is to think about what would ahve kept my attention when I was that age. When I was 10 I was difficult to pin down and was always having my name written on the board for talking to much, so I definitley relate to some of my students haha.

I'm also still at Barossa Eye Clinic. It has been difficult but rewarding learning all of these new analytical machines and how their data relates to build an insight into a patients opthalmic condition. I've been talking with the clinical owner about maybe writing some narrow AI for their machines for fun/exposure/academic clout. ðŸ˜…

The ambassadorship was fun, I have met a good range of people and enjoyed my time. However, I am equaly glad for it to be over because I had spread myself thin enough for 12 weeks, so it will be nice to unwind a little. 

Cybersecurity and Ethics are now over. Seeing them off was rewarding especially when I got a HD in both! It was hard work for both me and all of the people around me haivng to hear me complain haha. My partner was an absolute trooper. 


### Time for a new tired
I have just survived an unholy flu from last week. It was a spiritual experience leaving me searching for meaning in my suffering. I had a sinus migraine leaving me looking like this ðŸ˜µ. However, it did give me a chance to rest and recouperate to start fresh for Trimester 2. 

The Internship with AIML was susccesfully extended until the end of semester 1 ðŸŽ‰. The data needed to be reprocessed and various chedulign conflicts have impeded process but we are getting there.

Also, I get to start my capstone project this trimester, I am still in talks with what that will be so stay tuned!


ðŸ“Œ Also Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been an amazing Je'RPG and I would reccomend it to anyone who likes JRPGS
