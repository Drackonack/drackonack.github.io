title: That's A Wrap For Trimester 1
---

### Finished off Trimester 1
I've made it through! It's been quite the journey, but I've successfully completed Trimester 1 of my postgraduate studies. ðŸŽ‰

I'm so proud of my effort so let me share the good news: I managed to achieve a GPA of 7! It's been a challenging ride, especially with the exams, but I'm proud of everything I've achieved so far. I'm especially appreciative of support I recieved from my family, friends, peers, and partner.

I've been indulging in some much-needed downtime lately. Traveling to Melbourne, catching up on some social events with friends, smashing Dragon's Dogma 2, and getting bodied in Balatro have all been a nice change of pace. It's been the perfect way to unwind and recharge before diving into Trimester 2. ðŸš€ðŸ“šðŸŽ®
