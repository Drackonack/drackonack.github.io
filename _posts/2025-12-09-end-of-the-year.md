title: End Of The Year, End Of The Masters!

### That's It For The Year And The Masters!
I know I say this in just about all of my posts but this year especially trimester 03 has gone by so fast! 

**For Applied Machine Learning**  
I compared premade machine learning algorithms and a hand made neural network, for a personally hand collected ophthalmic dataset from raw machine output provided by Barossa Eye Clinic. This unfortunatley didn't turn out, so my final model with the best performance had a R^2 value of **0.09**. I was a little surprised but was able to find a scientific cause and explain this in my reports resulting in some good grades!

**For the Capstone Project**  
I was able to make a small finetuned LLM for teacher end of term report card comments, a 5 session professional developemnt workshop series about AI in the education sector for teaching and administration, and a small risk matrix and associated paperwork for the adoption of AI in an educational institution. 

**For AI Camp**  
With AI Camp I have been able to travel and go to Sydney to deliver professional development courses to schools about AI and also lead an AI art class for children at Prince Alfred College. Further to this, I also used my knowledge to develop a small educational material that was published via NeurIPS, titled [LLMs In Your Workflow](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ur0CYUsDjP). I wasnt able to go to the conference but it was nice to be apart of the process!

**For Barossa Eye Clinic**  
Barossa Eye Clinic has been very engaging to work with as always! Not only did they provide the avenue for me to make my own dataset for a uni project, they have also given me the space to come up with my own ideas for the clinic itself. So, if it goes well and I get the clearance hopefully I can talk more about that as well. 🤫 
  

Also, with consultation of my partner and cautious excitement for next year, we both put in and I got a Z13 flow with unified 128gb RAM to do AI development on 🧠🪲💻
  
***I have also applied for a PhD program startig for 2026, so fingers crossed 🤞***
