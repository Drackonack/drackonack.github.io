title: Thats 50 Down In Exercism

### 50 down and another 20 to go!
I set myself the challenge of solving at least 50% of Exercism's Python coding challenges before heading off for uni. At first this seemed quite daunting but its slowly coming together. The trick is to put the problem down and come back to it with fresh eyes... or eventually after many hours and days, asking a friend for help!

If i get through this goal with some time before classes begin, I was thinking of either spending some time in blender or maybe making a D&D 5e character sheet in Python.
