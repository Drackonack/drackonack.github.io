  Hello, I'm Drake
  
  I am currently a PhD student, studying causal AI for decision making. 

  I originally put this website together to document my journey from being an analytical immunoassay scientist, to a machine learning engineer. However, as I have studied and worked more in the field, I developed a love for the dscipline. So I keep studying and working, leading to my website/blog getting bigger!

  Thank you for visiting ☕
