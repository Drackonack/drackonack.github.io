  Hello, I'm Drake
  
  I am currently completing a Masters of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

  I started as an Immunoassay Analytical Scientist and have made the journey into becoming a Machine Learning Egnineer. 
  
  I've made this site to not only document the journey but also showcase some of my work.

  Thank you for visiting â˜•
