<h3>Learning Python from no computer background</h3>

I went around the app store and looked for a few apps that all taught python. I installed about 5 of them, trying each for a day. Until I found one:

<a style="display: flex; justify-content: center; background-color: #262845;" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getmimo&hl=en&gl=US" title="Mimo!">
    <img src="assets/img/Mimo.png" alt="Mimo!" />
</a>

Mimo was an excellent starting point for me. It was gamified like DuoLingo and held my hand every step of the way. 

Im currently 10/14 modules complete. When I hit 7/14, my partner who is a programming god (*at least to me*), suggested starting on Exercism.
