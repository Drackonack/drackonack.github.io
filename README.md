This is very exciting news to finish the year off with. I have been working consistently with Mimo and Exercism, as well as this website to ensure I am as prepared as possible. If all things go well, I am planning to extend this into a Masters.

<h3>Learning Python with no background in programming</h3>

I went around the app store and looked for a few apps that all taught python. I installed about 5 of them, trying each for a day. Until I found one:

</a>

Mimo was an excellent starting point for me. It was gamified like DuoLingo and held my hand every step of the way. 

Im currently 10/14 modules complete. When I hit 7/14, my partner who is a programming god (*at least to me*), suggested starting on Exercism.
